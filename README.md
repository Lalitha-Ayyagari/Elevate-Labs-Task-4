File Structure

NotesManager.java: The main Java source file containing the application logic.
notes.txt: Auto-generated file where notes are stored (created after the first note is added).

Notes

The program uses FileReader and FileWriter for file operations.
Notes are appended to notes.txt when created.
Updating or deleting a note preserves other notes in the file.
Basic error handling is included for file operations (e.g., file not found, I/O errors).
The program runs in an infinite loop until the user selects the "Exit" option.

Troubleshooting

"File not found" error: If notes.txt doesn't exist, create a note first to generate the file.
Compilation errors: Ensure JDK is installed and configured correctly in your environment.
Input issues: Enter valid numeric choices (1â€“5) for the menu and follow prompts for text input.
